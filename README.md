# Tower of Hanoi

Implemented with C# and includes unit tests.

Unit tests require `Moq 4.7.9` NuGet Package, which will be downloaded upon compilation.
(Click [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq/4.7.9/) for more info)

EXE should be run as follows:
TowerOfHanoi.exe "relative_path_to_text_file_with_game_flow.txt"

I also added a release with the compiled EXE.
